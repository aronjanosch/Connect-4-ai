"""
This heuristic is based on the following paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331552609_Research_on_Different_Heuristics_for_Minimax_Algorithm_Insight_from_Connect-4_Game
The basic idea is to separate a board state into four different feature levels, each handling a number of
connected stones and assigning scores with different orders of magnitude to them. These feature values are then
added together to form the heuristic value.
